A TODO list app with location reminders (via notifications) that remind the user to do any pending work when the user is at a specific location. 
The app asks the user to select a location(Users have the option to change map type) or POI on the map and add a new marker at that location Upon 
saving, the selected location is returned to the screen and the user is asked to input the title and description for the reminder. When the user 
enters a geofence, a reminder is retrieved from the local storage, and a notification showing the reminder title will appear, even if the app is not open.

Technologies used: Kotlin , authentication usig firebase UI ,Google map API ,Geofencing,Notification, Use of Espresso and Mockito to test the app etc

Here is the working of the app.
